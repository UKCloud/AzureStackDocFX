    "keywords": "Getting started guide for Sovereign Azure BETA Introduction UKCloud's Sovereign Azure service provides you with new options to harness Microsoft Azure alongside other cloud platform, including Oracle, VMware and OpenStack. This gives you the flexibility to accommodate diverse workloads within a low-latency, accredited platform with native connectivity to non-cloud workloads in Crown Hosting and the networks that are vital to the Public Sector: from PSN Protected to HSCN and RLI. This getting started guide provides you with the information you need to get up and running with your Sovereign Azure service. Intended audience To complete the steps in this guide, you must have access to UKCloud's Azure Stack portal. Sovereign Azure overview At UKCloud, we understand that there is no \"one size fits all\" solution. There are usually many factors to consider when looking to move your applications to the cloud, including existing technology investment and skills. Additionallredffrfjdfjdy, while some applications can easily move to the public cloud, there are others that for various reasons (latency, connectivity, security, regulation) must run on-premises. Microsoft Azure Stack is an extension of Azure that provides on-premises Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), enabling you to leverage the benefits of cloud in an on-premises environment. The Sovereign Azure service brings the advantages of the Microsoft Cloud platform to our assured UK-sovereign platform, helping you realise the benefits that a true hybrid cloud environment has to offer, while balancing the right amount of flexibility and control. With Sovereign Azure, you can: Leverage existing Azure investment, knowledge and skills Use Azure Stack alongside other technologies, for example, VMware, OpenStack or Oracle Connect to government community networks, including PSN, HSCN, Janet and RLI Meet specific compliance directives, such as data sovereignty or security The two main delivery models provided by our Sovereign Azure service are: A multi-tenant IaaS and PaaS platform available in both UKCloud security domains (Assured OFFICIAL and Elevated OFFICIAL), connected to government community networks with UKCloud's award-winning support Private cloud deployment of Sovereign Azure dedicated to a single customer Before you begin You should have received your Sovereign Azure login credentials from your Sovereign Azure administrator. If you're the administrator, your Customer Success Manager (CSM) will have provided you with your credentials. Logging in to the Microsoft Azure Stack portal To manage your Sovereign Azure service, you need to log in to UKCloud's Azure Stack portal. The portal provides access to all your Sovereign Azure resources. To log in to the Azure Stack portal: In your browser, go to the following URL: http://portal.frn00006.azure.ukcloud.com/ In the login dialog box, enter the email address for your Sovereign Azure account and click Next , or pick your account. Enter your password and click Sign in . After you log in, you'll see the main Azure Stack portal home page. On this page you'll see: A — Favourites panel Quickly access your most used resources (see link) B — Dashboard Access information about your Sovereign Azure resources (see link) C — Settings Change your portal settings, such as theme and language D — Notifications View useful alerts about your Sovereign Azure environment E — New Create new resources Understanding subscriptions, offers and plans Your Sovereign Azure environment is provisioned with a subscription that determines the services you have access to, and your quotas for those services. A subscription is a mechanism for signing up to an offer An offer is a collection of one or more plans A plan is a collection of one or more services , with associated quotas Customising your favourites In the Azure Stack portal, down the left-hand side, you can see a list of your favourite resources. You can customise this list to include the resources that you access most frequently. In the favourites panel of the Azure Stack portal, click the More services link. In the list of resources available to your subscription, resources that are included in your favourites panel are indicated by a yellow star icon. Tip! You can use the Filter field to filter the list of resources. You can order the list By category or By name . Click the grey star icon next to the resource that you want to add to your list of favourites. Tip! To remove a resource from the favourites panel, click the yellow star next to the service. When you're done, close the list of resources. You can now see the newly added resource in your favourites panel. You can reorder the resources in your favourites panel by dragging and dropping them. Customising and adding dashboards An Azure Stack dashboard consists of tiles that provide access to the resources available to your subscription. You can create multiple dashboards to provide different views of your resources. To customise a dashboard: In the Azure Stack portal, select the dashboard that you want to customise. Click the Edit dashboard option. Drag the tiles you want to add to the dashboard from the Tile Gallery onto the dashboard. To change the layout of a tile on the dashboard, hover your mouse over the tile, click the Context menu icon and select the new layout. Drag tiles to rearrange them on the dashboard. To delete a tile from the dashboard, hover your mouse over the tile and click the Unpin icon. When you're done, click Done customizing . To create a new dashboard, click the New dashboard option. Enter a name for the dashboard. Add and arrange tiles as described above and, when you're done, click Done customizing . Configuring the Azure CLI Azure provides a command line interface (CLI) that you can use to manage your Sovereign Azure resources. For example, you can use the Azure CLI to create virtual machines and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates. For more information, including steps for setting up the Azure CLI with Sovereign Azure and a list of known issues, see: https://github.com/UKCloud/AzureStack/tree/master/AzureCLI/Tenants Configuring the Azure Stack PowerShell client You can use PowerShell to manage your Sovereign Azure resources. For example, you can create virtual machines and deploy Azure Resource Manager templates. For more information, including steps and scripts for setting up Azure PowerShell with Sovereign Azure and a list of known issues, see: https://github.com/UKCloud/AzureStack/tree/master/PowerShell/Tenants Next steps Congratulations!

Adding new dependencies require additional approval. Current approved dependencies are: Newtonsoft.Json Jint HtmlAgilityPack Nustache YamlDotNet Code reviews and checkins To help ensure that only the highest quality code makes its way into the project, please submit all your code changes to GitHub as PRs. This includes runtime code changes, unit test updates, and deployment scripts. For example, sending a PR for just an update to a unit test might seem like a waste of time but the unit tests are just as important as the product code and as such, reviewing changes to them is also just as important. The advantages are numerous: improving code quality, more visibility on changes and their potential impact, avoiding duplication of effort, and creating general awareness of progress being made in various areas. In general a PR should be signed off(using the 👍 emoticon) by the Owner of that code. To commit the PR to the repo do not use the Big Green Button . Instead, do a typical push that you would use with Git (e.g. local pull, rebase, merge, push). Source Code Management Branch strategy In general: master has the code for the latest release on NuGet.org. (e.g. 1.0.0 , 1.1.0 ) dev has the code that is being worked on but not yet released. This is the branch into which devs normally submit pull requests and merge changes into. We run daily CI towards dev branch and generate pre-release nuget package, e.g. 1.0.1-alpha-9-abcdefsd . hotfix has the code for fixing master bug after it is released. hotfix changes will be merged back to master and dev once it is verified. Solution and project folder structure and naming Solution files go in the repo root. The default entry point is All.sln . Every project also needs a project.json and a matching .xproj file. This project.json is the source of truth for a project's dependencies and configuration options. Solution need to contain solution folders that match the physical folder ( src , test , tools , etc.). Assembly naming pattern The general naming pattern is Microsoft.DocAsCode.<area>.<subarea> . Unit tests We use xUnit.net for all unit testing.

    "keywords": "C# Coding Standards Introduction The coding standard will be used in conjunction with customized version of StyleCop and FxCop [ TODO ] during both development and build process. This will help ensure that the standard is followed by all developers on the team in a consistent manner. \"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans understand\". Martin Fowler. Refactoring: Improving the design of existing code. Purpose The aim of this section is to define a set of C# coding standards to be used by CAPS build team to guarantee maximum legibility, reliability, re-usability and homogeneity of our code. Each section is marked Mandatory or Recommended . Mandatory sections, will be enforced during code reviews as well as tools like StyleCop and FxCop , and code will not be considered complete until it is compliant. Scope This section contains general C# coding standards which can be applied to any type of application developed in C#, based on Framework Design Guidelines . It does not pretend to be a tutorial on C#. It only includes a set of limitations and recommendations focused on clarifying the development. Tools Resharper is a great 3rd party code cleanup and style tool. StyleCop analyzes C# srouce code to enforce a set of style and consistency rules and has been integrated into many 3rd party development tools such as Resharper. FxCop is an application that analyzes managed code assemblies (code that targets the .NET Framework common language runtime) and reports information about the assemblies, such as possible design, localization, performance, and security improvements. C# Stylizer does many of the style rules automatically Highlights of Coding Standards This section is not intended to give a summary of all the coding standards that enabled by our customized StyleCop, but to give a highlight of some rules one will possibly meet in daily coding life. It also provides some recommended however not mandatory(which means not enabled in StyleCop) coding standards. File Layout (Recommended) Only one public class is allowed per file. The file name is derived from the class name. Class : Observer Filename: Observer.cs Class Definition Order (Mandatory) The class definition contains class members in the following order, from less restricted scope (public) to more restrictive (private): Nested types, e.g. classes, enum, struct, etc. Field members, e.g. member variables, const, etc. Member functions Constructors Finalizer (Do not use unless absolutely necessary) Methods (Properties, Events, Operations, Overridables, Static) Private nested types Naming (Mandatory) DO use PascalCasing for all public member, type, and namespace names consisting of multiple words. PropertyDescriptor HtmlTag IOStream NOTE : A special case is made for two-letter acronyms in which both letters are capitalized, e.g. IOStream DO use camelCasing for parameter names. propertyDescriptor htmlTag ioStream DO start with underscore for private fields private readonly Guid _userId = Guid.NewGuid(); DO start static readonly fields, constants with capitalized case private static readonly IEntityAccessor EntityAccessor = null; private const string MetadataName = \"MetadataName\"; DO NOT capitalize each word in so-called closed-form compound words . DO have \"Async\" explicitly in the Async method name to notice people how to use it properly Formatting (Mandatory) DO use spaces over tabs, and always show all spaces/tabs in IDE Tips Visual Studio > TOOLS > Options > Text Editor > C# > Tabs > Insert spaces (Tab size: 4) Visual Studio > Edit > Advanced > View White Space DO add using inside namespace declaration namespace Microsoft.Content.Build.BuildWorker.UnitTest { using System; } DO add a space when: for (var i = 0; i < 1; i++) if (a == b) Cross-platform coding Our code should supports multiple operating systems. Don't assume we only run (and develop) on Windows. Code should be sensitvie to the differences between OS's. Here are some specifics to consider. DO use Enviroment.NewLine instead of hard-coding the line break instead of \\r\\n , as Windows uses \\r\\n and OSX/Linux uses \\n . Note Be aware that thes line-endings may cause problems in code when using @\"\" text blocks with line breaks. DO Use Path.Combine() or Path.DirectorySeparatorChar to separate directories. If this is not possible (such as in scripting), use a forward slash / . Windows is more forgiving than Linux in this regard. Unit tests and functional tests Assembly naming The unit tests for the Microsoft.Foo assembly live in the Microsoft.Foo.Tests assembly. The functional tests for the Microsoft.Foo assmebly live in the Microsoft.Foo.FunctionalTests assmebly. In general there should be exactly one unit test assebmly for each product runtime assembly. In general there should be one functional test assembly per repo. Exceptions can be made for both. Unit test class naming Test class names end with Test and live in the same namespace as the class being tested. For example, the unit tests for the Microsoft.Foo.Boo class would be in a Microsoft.Foo.Boo class in the test assembly. Unit test method naming Unit test method names must be descriptive about what is being tested, under what conditions, and what the expectations are . Pascal casing and underscores can be used to improve readability. The following test names are correct: PublicApiArgumentsShouldHaveNotNullAnnotation Public_api_arguments_should_have_not_null_annotation The following test names are incorrect: Test1 Constructor FormatString GetData Unit test structure The contents of every unit test should be split into three distinct stages, optionally separated by these comments: // Arrange // Act // Assert The crucial thing here is the Act stage is exactly one statement. That one statement is nothing more than a call to the one method that you are trying to test. keeping that one statement as simple as possible is also very important. For example, this is not ideal: int result = myObj.CallSomeMethod(GetComplexParam1(), GetComplexParam2(), GetComplexParam3()); This style is not recomended because way too many things can go wrong in this one statement. All the GetComplexParamN() calls can throw for a variety of reasons unrelated to the test itself. It is thus unclear to someone running into a problem why the failure occured. The ideal pattern is to move the complex parameter building into the `Arrange section: // Arrange P1 p1 = GetComplexParam1(); P2 p2 = GetComplexParam2(); P3 p3 = GetComplexParam3(); // Act int result = myObj.CallSomeMethod(p1, p2, p3); // Assert Assert.AreEqual(1234, result); Now the only reason the line with CallSomeMethod() can fail is if the method itself blew up. Testing exception messages In general testing the specific exception message in a unit test is important. This ensures that the exact desired exception is what is being tested rather than a different exception of the same type. In order to verify the exact exception it is important to verify the message. var ex = Assert.Throws<InvalidOperationException>( () => fruitBasket.GetBananaById(1234)); Assert.Equal( \"1234\", ex.Message); Use xUnit.net's plethora of built-in assertions xUnit.net includes many kinds of assertions – please use the most appropriate one for your test. This will make the tests a lot more readable and also allow the test runner report the best possible errors (whether it's local or the CI machine). For example, these are bad: Assert.Equal(true, someBool); Assert.True(\"abc123\" == someString); Assert.True(list1.Length == list2.Length); for (int i = 0; i < list1.Length; i++) { Assert.True( String.Equals list1[i], list2[i], StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)); } These are good: Assert.True(someBool); Assert.Equal(\"abc123\", someString); // built-in collection assertions! Assert.Equal(list1, list2, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase); Parallel tests By default all unit test assemblies should run in parallel mode, which is the default. Unit tests shouldn't depend on any shared state, and so should generally be runnable in parallel. If the tests fail in parallel, the first thing to do is to figure out why; do not just disable parallel tests! For functional tests it is reasonable to disable parallel tests."

Prerequisites Prerequisites from a Windows-based external client. PowerShell 5.1 Azure Stack PowerShell Modules -> Azure Stack Modules Install Guide Important Always consult Microsoft documentation for your specific Update Version Example -> 1802 Update Caution In the 1802 example you can see that you need to install a Hotfix before you apply the upgrade. That is one of the many reasons why you should always check the official documentation. High Level Overview of the process Important We strongly recommend that you notify users of any maintenance operations, and that you schedule normal maintenance windows during non-business hours as much as possible. Maintenance operations may affect both user workloads and portal operations. Raise a pre-emptive case with Microsoft prior to starting the Update. Download required packages. Full Manual procedure can be found here -> more Download link -> download Upload the packages to Azure Stack. Start Update process.
